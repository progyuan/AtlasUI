I have come across a couple file errors in regards to their names. If you come up with a couple "resources not found" or whatever the hell the microsoft error is, if it has something to do with
office v3.png and/or Tick(2).png

It's because I changed the names to officev3.png and Tick.png

If you are a Visual Basic developer and fix this issue, please upload the necessary files to fix it! Thanks you :)
